# The Autograph Protocol

Autograph is an open, modular cryptographic protocol that implements a
decentralized credential management system. It is efficient enough to run on
virtually any type of device, completely offline.

Currently, there are three native implementations of the protocol written in
[C](./cplusplus), [Go](./go), and [Rust](./rust). The C implementation has
bindings to [C++](./cplusplus), [Kotlin](./android), [Swift](./apple), and
[TypeScript](./typescript).
